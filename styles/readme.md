### Naming conventions

Use `wir-` prefix for names of project-level context-free css classes; combine such classes with others freely. Samples:

- `wir-content-padding` defines standart wir paddings (left and right) for all screen sizes;
- `wir-no-background` and `wir-with-background` provides unified way to distinguish black-backgrounded and white-backgrounded areas (if needed).
